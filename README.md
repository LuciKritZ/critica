# CrÃ­tica - Book rating application

## About Me

Being confused whether which book to read next is a very common problem for the readers. Due to a lot of recommendations from peers and the internet, it gets difficult to get a good suggestion. Critica solves this problem by providing the book suggestions based on the reviews of the top critics.
